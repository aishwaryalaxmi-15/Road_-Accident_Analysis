# Road Accident Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze road accident data to identify trends, patterns, and factors contributing to accidents. By leveraging **Power BI** and **Excel**, we have created dashboards and reports to provide actionable insights into road safety.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preparation using Excel.
- Interactive dashboards and visualizations in Power BI.
- Trend analysis for accidents over time.
- Insights into key factors like accident severity, time, location, and weather conditions.

## Dataset
The dataset used includes:
- **Location**: City and region where the accidents occurred.
- **Time**: Date and time of accidents.
- **Severity**: Minor, major, or fatal accidents.
- **Weather**: Conditions during the time of the accident.
- **Casualties**: Number of injuries and fatalities.

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle that contains 4000+ data

## Tools Used
- **Excel**: For data cleaning, preparation, and basic analysis.
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.

## How to Use
1. Open the dataset file (stored in the `data` folder) in Excel for review and cleaning.
2. Import the cleaned data into Power BI.
3. Use the provided Power BI report file (`road_accident_dashboard.pbix`) to explore the interactive visualizations.

### Example Steps:
- **In Excel**: Perform steps like removing duplicates, filtering invalid data, and adding calculated columns.
- **In Power BI**: Use tools like slicers, filters, and visuals to analyze data trends and relationships.

## Key Insights
- **Insight 1**: Accidents are more frequent during weekends and holidays.
- **Insight 2**: Urban areas see more accidents due to higher traffic density.
- **Insight 3**: Rainy weather significantly increases the number of accidents.

Here are some examples of the dashboards created in Power BI:

1. **Accident Trends Dashboard**
   - Line charts showing accidents over time.
   - Slicers to filter by weather and location.

2. **Accident Severity Breakdown**
   - Pie charts and bar graphs categorizing accidents by severity.
